# Browser Automation with playwright-cli

## Mobile-first: this project ALWAYS runs at Samsung Galaxy S8 360x740

UVA App is a **mobile-first** app. Every browser session opened with
`playwright-cli` in this repo is automatically emulated as an **Samsung Galaxy S8
(3rd gen): 375×667 px, deviceScaleFactor 2, touch enabled**.

This is enforced by `.playwright/cli.config.json` (the default config file that
`playwright-cli` loads automatically). **You do not need to pass any flag** — just
run `playwright-cli open ...` and the viewport is already mobile.

**All UI validation must be done at this 375×667 mobile size.**

```bash
playwright-cli --raw eval "JSON.stringify({w: innerWidth, h: innerHeight, dpr: devicePixelRatio})"
# expected: {"w":360,"h":740,"dpr":3}
```

> Note: the config uses the system Chrome channel (`launchOptions.channel: "chrome"`)
> so no extra browser download is needed. Chromium is required for mobile
> emulation (`isMobile`/`hasTouch`) — do not switch to firefox/webkit.

## Login with test user (no OTP required)

**Test phone: `3000000002`** — authenticates automatically, goes directly to home.

The dev server runs on **port 4200** (`ionic serve` or `npm start`).

```bash
# 1. Open the app
playwright-cli open http://localhost:4200

# 2. Fill phone number (10 digits, NO +57 prefix — the app adds it)
playwright-cli fill "getByRole('textbox')" "3000000002"

# 3. Click Continuar
playwright-cli click "getByRole('button', { name: 'Continuar' })"

# 4. Confirm the phone number in the modal
playwright-cli click "getByRole('button', { name: 'Sí, continuar' })"

# 5. App navigates automatically: login → register/project-vinculation → app/tabs/home
#    No OTP screen. Wait for DataStore sync, then snapshot to confirm.
playwright-cli snapshot
```

If button targeting fails, use text-based selectors:
```bash
playwright-cli click "getByText('Sí, continuar')"
```

## Raw output

playwright-cli --raw snapshot > before.yml
playwright-cli click e5
playwright-cli --raw snapshot > after.yml
diff before.yml after.yml
TOKEN=$(playwright-cli --raw cookie-get session_id)

```

## Open parameters
```bash
# Use specific browser when creating session
playwright-cli open --browser=chrome
playwright-cli open --browser=firefox
playwright-cli open --browser=webkit
playwright-cli open --browser=msedge

# Use persistent profile (by default profile is in-memory)
playwright-cli open --persistent
# Use persistent profile with custom directory
playwright-cli open --profile=/path/to/profile

# Connect to browser via extension
playwright-cli attach --extension

# Start with config file
playwright-cli open --config=my-config.json

# Close the browser
playwright-cli close
# Delete user data for the default session
playwright-cli delete-data
```

## Snapshots

After each command, playwright-cli provides a snapshot of the current browser state.

```bash
> playwright-cli goto http://localhost:4200
### Page
- Page URL: http://localhost:4200/
- Page Title: UVA App
### Snapshot
[Snapshot](.playwright-cli/page-2026-06-11T10-00-00-000Z.yml)
```

## Targeting elements

By default, use refs from the snapshot to interact with page elements.

```bash
# get snapshot with refs
playwright-cli snapshot

# interact using a ref
playwright-cli click e15
```

You can also use css selectors or Playwright locators.

```bash
# css selector
playwright-cli click "#main > button.submit"

# role locator
playwright-cli click "getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })"

# test id
playwright-cli click "getByTestId('submit-button')"
```

## Browser Sessions

```bash
# create new browser session named "mysession" with persistent profile
playwright-cli -s=mysession open example.com --persistent
playwright-cli -s=mysession click e6
playwright-cli -s=mysession close  # stop a named browser
playwright-cli -s=mysession delete-data  # delete user data for persistent session

playwright-cli list
# Close all browsers
playwright-cli close-all
# Forcefully kill all browser processes
playwright-cli kill-all
```

## Installation

If global `playwright-cli` command is not available, try a local version via `npx playwright-cli`:

```bash
npx --no-install playwright-cli --version
```

When local version is available, use `npx playwright-cli` in all commands. Otherwise, install `playwright-cli` as a global command:

```bash
npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
```
